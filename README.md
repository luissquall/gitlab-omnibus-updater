Introduction:
-------------

This is just a small script to update an existing Gitlab instance to a newer version. Basically it just executes the commands from the Gitlab documentation, but in an automated way (hint: automation).

How to update GitLab?
---------------------

Just grab the script, make it executable and run it like this::

	sudo /path/to/update-gitlab-omnibus.sh


Thanks

While it was an idea on it's own to create this script, I also looked for existing solutions. The script is somewhat inspired by the work of https://github.com/heichblatt/gitlab-omnibus-update - thanks!
